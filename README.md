# World Market Study for International Expansion Based on FAO data

# Introduction:

This GitHub repository details a comprehensive market study aimed at supporting our company's international expansion efforts. Given our growing success in the French market, we aim to explore potential opportunities worldwide. This project involves a detailed analysis of various indicators provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). We will start with preliminary data exploration to prepare the datasets for further analysis. Subsequently, we will delve into an extensive examination using hierarchical clustering, visualized through dendrograms, followed by k-means clustering to refine our analysis and compare the results of both clustering methods. We will also study the centroids of our clusters and perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize our findings, understand the groups, and explore the relationships between variables and individuals. The outcome will be a list of countries that are likely candidates for our international expansion.

# Data Preparation:
